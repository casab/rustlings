# rustlings ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è

This project contains small exercises to get people used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

Alternatively, for a first-time Rust learner, there's several other resources:

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) - The most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, but a bit theoretical sometimes. You will be using this along with Rustlings!
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - Learn Rust by solving little exercises! It's almost like `rustlings`, but online

## Credits

`rustlings` was originally written by [Carol](https://github.com/carols10cents)!
